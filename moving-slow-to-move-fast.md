I'll always be a [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) fan. He was on a recent Changelog podcast "[Retired not Tired](https://changelog.com/podcast/595)" and he said a lot of things that resonated. One piece of knowledge he dropped was around these electrical installer competitions. He talks about how the person whose winning is methodical.

> He moving slow...and he's done 30% faster then everybody else. He is methodical.

Contrast it to the people who are moving fast:

> Everybody else is picking it up, moving the ladder, picking it up, moving the ladder

They continue to talk about moving slow to move fast which I agree with. Most of my screw ups happen because I'm moving fast. It feels like I'm moving the ladder repeatedly. Except instead of a ladder it's push a PR, find a bug, push a PR.

Then Kelsey adds the missing piece. That to be methodical, you have to be good at what you do. You have to put in the work.

> It's the people that don't quite have the skills down and they have to compensate for the lack of skills by doing stuff seven times

The entire podcast episode was full of great stuff. Give it a listen if you haven't already!
