I've been away from Ruby on Rails for a [couple of years](https://jonathanyeong.com/what-i-missed-about-ruby/). And in that time, Rails introduced [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), and [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/). In this post, I extend my [Rails nested from tutorial](https://jonathanyeong.com/what-i-missed-about-ruby/) by adding a button to dynamically add new nested form elements using a [Stimulus Nested Form component](https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-rails-nested-form/).

We're going all in on Rails, so I'll be using the default [importmap JS package manager](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails).

## Set up
Let's first install the Stimulus nested form component

```bash
bin/importmap pin @stimulus-components/rails-nested-form 
```

Update `app/javascript/controllers/application.js` to register the stimulus component.

```js
import { Application } from "@hotwired/stimulus" // Should exist already
import RailsNestedForm from '@stimulus-components/rails-nested-form'

const application = Application.start() // Should exist already
application.register('nested-form', RailsNestedForm)
...
```

Let's modify our [previous form](https://jonathanyeong.com/nested-forms-in-rails/) by moving our nested fields into a partial. First create the partial `app/views/training_sessions/_training_step_fields.html.erb` and add the following code:

```ruby
# app/views/training_sessions/_training_step_fields.html.erb 
<%= f.label :description %>
<%= f.text_field :description %>
```

After we create our partial, we can modify the form in `new.html.erb`:

```ruby
# app/views/training_sessions/new.html.erb
<%= form_with model: @training_session do |form| %>
  Session Steps:
  
  <%= form.fields_for :training_steps do |training_steps_form| %>
    <%= render partial: "training_step_fields", locals: { f: training_steps_form } %>
  <% end %>
  
  <%= form.submit "Create New Session" %>
<% end %>
```

At this point, when we go to `training_sessions/new` we should see the same behaviour as before.

## Implementing Stimulus Nested Form Component

Let's implement the Stimulus component. Modify your `new.html.erb` to add a Stimulus target:

```ruby
<%= form_with model: @training_session do |form| %>
  Session Steps:
  <template data-nested-form-target="template">
    <%= form.fields_for :training_steps, TrainingStep.new, child_index: 'NEW_RECORD' do |training_steps_form| %>
      <%= render partial: "training_step_fields", locals: { f: training_steps_form }%>
    <% end %>
  </template>


  <%= form.fields_for :training_steps do |training_steps_form| %>
    <%= render partial: "training_step_fields", locals: { f: training_steps_form } %>
  <% end %>

  <div data-nested-form-target="target"></div>

  <button type="button" data-action="nested-form#add">Add Training Step</button>
  
  <%= form.submit "Create New Session" %>
<% end %>
```

Now if we reload our app there's now a button that lets you add more training steps ðŸŽ‰.

## Breaking down the changes
Let's break down the changes.

```ruby
<template data-nested-form-target="template">
...
</template>

<div data-nested-form-target="target"></div>
```

We register two targets with Stimulus, `template` and `target`. The `template` target, which in Stimulus, gets referred to as `this.templateTarget` is inserted into `this.targetTarget` via `insertAdjacentHTML`. The template is defined similar to our original definition of the training_step fields. But it has two additional params: `TrainingSteps.new` and `child_index: 'NEW_RECORD'`

```ruby
<%= form.fields_for :training_steps, TrainingStep.new, child_index: 'NEW_RECORD' do |training_steps_form| %>
  ...
<% end %>
```

Rails requires the index of nested fields to be unique. It does enforces uniqueness via a `child_index`. See the [Rails docs](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/fields_for#512-Setting-child-index-while-using-nested-attributes-mass-assignment). We must keep the `NEW_RECORD` value. Stimulus nested form component will replace the term `NEW_RECORD` with `Date.getTime().toString()`.

`TrainingStep.new` is used to build a new instance of the Training Step model. Without this model, we'll see some odd behaviour where we add two fields every time we press the "Add Training Step" button. Note: the **two** comes from our controller: `2.times { @training_session.training_steps.build }`. 

**Fun fact**: even though two form elements get added, only one of those elements get saved! Can you guess why? That's right, it's because the child index for those elements are the same. Rails will only save the last of the two values.

For reference, here's [the component source code](https://github.com/stimulus-components/stimulus-rails-nested-form/blob/master/src/index.ts).
