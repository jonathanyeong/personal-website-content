I'm back in Ruby on Rails land after two years using only Node/TS. And I'm thrilled to be back! I feel like I missed so much progress with Rails 7 over the last 2 years. But now that I'm back, I can finally use all the things I missed. Here's all the things that I took for granted before my break:

- Convention is enforced in Rails. Organization is much easier in a rails project, and I'm able to hop into any Rails project and find my way around.
- *Some* magic is nice. Such as auto-loading files!
- Rails console!!! Omg being able to run code snippets is amazing. I downloaded [RunJS](https://runjs.app/)to be able to achieve the same thing. But it's not a replacement for being able to play around with the data along with your code.
- Mocking with RSpec is way easier than Jest. In Node/TS, we used dependency injection to be able to mock classes and methods. But it was annoying to use dependency injection when it was only used in testing. *Please let me know if there's a better way to do it*.
- Having Rails routes to get an overview of all the entry points to the app is so underrated.

One thing that I took away from the last two years, is typing. I'm not going to lie. I like it. It's nice to be able to hover over an object and know what fields exist in it. I would love with Ruby to be able to hover over a hash and see all the keys that exist. I added [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) and [RBS](https://github.com/ruby/rbs) to my things to learn list.
