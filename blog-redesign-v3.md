After a months-long redesign with some stops and starts, I'm psyched to finally share my new site with you!

I'm a sucker for behind the scenes posts. I love reading them. I love writing them. I was particularly inspired by the Redesigning Piccalilli series. So I thought it would be interesting to go over my goals for the design, the design process, and key moments in the build.

## Goals for the design

Before jumping into Figma, I wrote down some goals for the redesign.

1. The main purpose of this site is a blog. Posts should be easy to read and discover, with a touch of personal curation (recommended or featured posts).
2. I want something that's personal and friendly. I'd like it to be minimal but not too much where information is hidden. With a focus on typography, splashes of colour maybe something green.
3. Newsletter CTA. I'd love to have more people find my newsletter.
4. A design I can build in a reasonable amount of time, and extensible in the future.

I also stuck with [Astro](https://astro.build/) because working with it has been a joy.
## Design Phase

During the design phase, I had three design iterations. The first iteration I finished at the end of 2024. The last I finished sometime last month.

In the first iteration, I wanted to display more information so that you could understand who I was at a glance. As well as introduce some sort of post curation. I was tired of the plain old homepage, so I added more colours and photos. I was also really into gradients last year.

The second iteration went a completely different direction. I switched to warmer colours, opting for something more minimal. I also switched out the heading font to [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) on the homepage. I really love how round and friendly it feels.

Unfortunately, both the first and second iterations were difficult to build. And when I stopped to think about it, neither design checked all my goals.

Which brings us to the final iteration!

I changed out the hero because it just didn’t work when the screen was super wide. Instead, I took inspiration from the original introduction paragraph and turned it into a hero. I also made the About section an actual page. I'd like to extend that page in the future.

[![Third and final iteration of my personal site redesign](https://res.cloudinary.com/jonathan-yeong/image/upload/v1745081737/unsigned_obsidian_uploads/aj0rfztpwahdazg67cxh.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/jonathan-yeong/image/upload/v1745081737/unsigned_obsidian_uploads/aj0rfztpwahdazg67cxh.png)

One thing I love about Figma is how easy it is to preserve your iteration process. Here’s what it looked like designing from a blank page to the second and final iteration. It's not the most efficient design process but it looks neat!

## Build Phase

During the build phase, I deviated a little from my design. Thankfully, I don't need to be perfect during design because I'm the one building it.

I want to highlight some key changes in this build. But before I can get cracking. I have to undo my past decisions:

- I removed Tailwind and rolled my own CSS. No shade against Tailwind. But I want to learn CSS, not Tailwind.
- I reintroduced my blog posts hierarchy with `/writing`. I thought it looked cool to have a flat hierarchy. But it felt odd with file based routing.
- I retired my logo that I've had for years. It still lives as a favicon, but I felt like it clashed with the rest of the design.

Onto the key changes!
### Light Dark Theme

It's been a while since I've written CSS. And there's been so many cool things since I've last touched it. The CSS [`light-dark` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) is one of those things.

In my stylesheet, I set the `:root` pseudoclass to use the [light dark color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) along with some light-dark variables:

```css
:root {
	color-scheme: light dark;
	--color-text: light-dark(var(--color-dark-text), var(--color-light-text));
	--color-bg: light-dark(var(--color-light-bg), var(--color-dark-bg));
}
```

To implement the theme switcher, I first check if there's a theme in local storage. If there's not, then I get the browser theme. Then I toggle the theme, and set `color-scheme` to the new theme, as well as update the local storage.

```js
const preferredColorScheme = (() => {
	return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light';
});

const handleToggleClick = () => {
	const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || preferredColorScheme()
    const newTheme = currentTheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('color-scheme', newTheme)
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
}
```

I also wanted to make sure my code blocks switch between dark and light mode. Under the hood, Astro uses Shiki to parse markdown code blocks. And it has hooks to modify the Shiki config:

```js
// In astro.config.js
shikiConfig: {
  themes: {
	dark: 'everforest-dark',
	light: 'everforest-light',
  },
  defaultColor: false
},
```

It's important to set `defaultColor` to false because that will generate a token with both light and dark variables. Example from [Shiki docs](https://shiki.style/guide/dual-themes#light-dark-dual-themes):

```html
<span style="--shiki-dark:#D8DEE9;--shiki-light:#2E3440">console</span>
```

Then in my CSS, I use `light-dark` function to switch between the two variables:

```css
.astro-code,
.astro-code span {
  color: light-dark(var(--shiki-light), var(--shiki-dark));
  background-color: light-dark(var(--shiki-light-bg), var(--shiki-dark-bg));
  /* Optional, if you also want font styles */
  font-style: light-dark(var(--shiki-light-font-style), var(--shiki-dark-font-style));
  font-weight: light-dark(var(--shiki-light-font-weight), var(--shiki-dark-font-weight));
  text-decoration: light-dark(var(--shiki-light-text-decoration), var(--shiki-dark-text-decoration));
}
```

This way a user can manually toggle the theme, or set their browser appearance and the code blocks will change colours correctly.
### Animating the Hero text

I wanted to try my hand at animating some text using only CSS. It's a small experiment to get myself more comfortable with animations.

First, let's start with the HTML:

```html
<p>
    <span class="animate-phrase">Hey I'm Jono.</span>
    <span class="animate-phrase">Backend developer.</span>
    <span class="animate-phrase">Learning to build delightful websites.</span>
    <span class="animate-phrase">Telling stories along the way.</span>
    <span class="animate-phrase">Obsessed about developer experience.</span>
</p>
```

I wanted to have each span slide in staggered from each other.

So my CSS had to:

1. Setup the initial state of the text.
2. Define a key frame that transitions from the initial to final state.
3. For each `animate-phrase`, add an animation with a slight delay to stagger each phrase.

I had to make sure I was setting the [animation-fill-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode) to `forwards`. This would mean that `animate-phrase` will retain the properties of the last keyframe.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    .animate-phrase {
	  display: inline-block;
      opacity: 0;
      transform: translateY(50px);
    }

    @keyframes slideUp {
      0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(50px);
      }
      100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
      }
    }

    .animate-phrase:nth-child(1) {
      animation: slideUp 500ms ease-out 0ms 1 forwards;
    }
    .animate-phrase:nth-child(2) {
      animation: slideUp 500ms ease-out 100ms 1 forwards;
    }
    .animate-phrase:nth-child(3) {
      animation: slideUp 500ms ease-out 200ms 1 forwards;
    }
    .animate-phrase:nth-child(4) {
      animation: slideUp 500ms ease-out 300ms 1 forwards;
    }
    .animate-phrase:nth-child(5) {
      animation: slideUp 500ms ease-out 400ms 1 forwards;
    }
}
```

While this CSS transition wasn't too bad. I can see why you would switch to using a JS library. It's a pain to manage the delay for the stagger. If I were using a JS animation library like [anime.js](https://animejs.com/), it could look like this:

```js
import { createTimeline, stagger } from 'animejs';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
	const timeline = createTimeline();
	timeline
	  .add('.animate-phrase', {
		opacity: [0, 1],
		translateY: [50, 0],
		duration: 500,
		delay: stagger(100)
	  })
});
```

### Subscribing users to my newsletter

Beehiiv has an API you can use to subscribe emails to your newsletter. I could leverage Astro's server side rendering to call this API.

First I setup a new `pages/api/subscribe.ts` file that contained the backend code. Adding `export const prerender = false` tells Astro that this file should be server side rendered.

*For brevity, I omitted validations and error checking in the following code blocks.*

```javascript
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro'

export const prerender = false

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => {
	const formData = await request.formData();
	const email = formData.get("email");
	const beehiivUrl = `https://api.beehiiv.com/v2/publications/${import.meta.env.BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID}/subscriptions`

	const response = await fetch(beehiivUrl, {
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
		  "Content-Type": "application/json",
		  "Authorization": `Bearer ${import.meta.env.BEEHIIV_API_KEY}`
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({ email }),
	});

	return new Response(
		JSON.stringify({
			message: "Success! Check your email to confirm!"
		}),
		{ status: 200 }
	);
}
```

Next in my `Newsletter.astro` component, I set up the client side code to call this backend endpoint.

```javascript
const formElement = document.getElementById('newsletterForm') as HTMLFormElement;

formElement.onsubmit = async (e) => {
	e.preventDefault();

	try {
		const formData = new FormData(formElement);
		const email = formData.get("email")
		const response = await fetch("/api/subscribe", {
			method: "POST",
			body: formData,
		});

		const result = await response.json();
        formElement.reset();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
};
```

The last thing was to add the corresponding adapter to my Astro config. I'm using [Netlify](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/) so I added `adapter: netlify()`.

Huge props to Astro for making hybrid rendering relatively easy! I love that I can statically render my `Newsletter.astro` component but have it call a server side rendered route.

## Conclusion

I learnt so much throughout this redesign. It's given me an appreciation of both design and frontend. That shit is hard! I already have a laundry list of things I want to add and tweak. But for now, the major part is done.

I hope you like the new design! Let me know what you think. Shoot me an [email](mailto:hey@jonathanyeong.com) or DM me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanyeong.com)!
