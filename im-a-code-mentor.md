I got an email yesterday that I was accepted as a mentor in [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/)! CodeMentor is an online platform that connects devs with mentors. There's also a freelance side to it. 

Here's the process to be a mentor:

1. I followed [this page](https://www.codementor.io/mentor/apply) to become a code mentor.
2. I was given a mock question about a bug in a mentees code. I had to write a short paragraph explaining what the bug was and what I would say to my mentee.
3. I was then asked to record a video explaining what the internet is to a person waking up from a 30-year-old coma.

The entire process was very fast, and the support team was very responsive to my questions. 

I have zero expectations on this platform. But I think resources like these are invaluable. Getting help from one person can help you skip years of struggling in your career. I've learnt a lot from my mentors. And I'm excited to share their knowledge with others.
