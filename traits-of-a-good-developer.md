I want to preface this post with the fact that this is my opinion.

I had a conversation with a newly senior dev the other day. It went a little something like this:

Them: "I just had a look at your code, you have this function twice. We should refactor."
Me: "Why though? I don't see a need to refactor this duplicated code yet"
Them: "Duplication is bad, we should get rid of it."

At this point, I'm already scratching my head. This conversation feels like absolutist speak.
