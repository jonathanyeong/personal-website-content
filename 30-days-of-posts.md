I came across [this blog post](https://rachsmith.com/weblogpomo/) by Rach Smith where they talk about Weblog Posting month. A challenge in May where you post on your blog every day. I love this idea. I haven't posted on my blog very consistently, mostly due to feeling [burnt out](https://jonathanyeong.com/burnout-is-a-sneaky-bugger/). So the challenge of posting every day is inspiring! I loved reading through Rach's posts because they range from technical content to personal thoughts or anecdotes. It makes me feel better about posting whatever.

Unfortunately, I can't join the #WeblogPoMo2024 challenge because I'm super late to the party. But I'm going to challenge myself to post every day for the next 30 days. And you might have noticed already that I have a few posts under my belt. I wanted to see if I could get through a week before committing. Under promise, overdeliver.

You might ask why am I doing this?

Firstly, I like a challenge. And I need that extra motivation to start posting again.

Secondly, I want to get better at writing and find my voice. The only way to get better is to force myself to write in public.

Thirdly, I'm hoping to build a "post brain" (relevant [Rach Smith post](https://rachsmith.com/post-brain/)). I'd like to flex that muscle that tells me when I should write about an experience.

Finally, I tend to have countless notes in draft which I don't post because I think they're stupid, and no one will read them. I'm working really hard to quiet that voice in my head.

I hope you'll enjoy the random thoughts that come out of my head!
