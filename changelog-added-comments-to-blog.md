I recently added [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments to my blog. It utilizes Github Discussions to store and track reactions and comments. You can see it in action on my [personal website repo](https://github.com/jonathanyeong/personal-website/discussions). Setup was also straightforward, fill out the details in the form and it spits out a script to embed onto your page!

Test it out!
