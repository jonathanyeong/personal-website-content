Today marks the end of my [30 days of posts challenge](https://jonathanyeong.com/30-days-of-posts/). Phew, it's been a journey. I did miss two days of posts. But I was also able to get back to posting after I had broken my streak. I honestly thought I would run out of things to say after the first week. So I'm happy that I made it through the 30 days.

What did I enjoy about the challenge?

- The little voice in my head that tells me my posts are dumb was drowned out because of the time constraints. I wonder if that voice will be louder now.
- Having my blog become a playground of ideas and exploration was really fun. No idea was too small to write about. And making mistakes was okay!
- Finding ways to optimise my posting workflow. I doubled down on Obsidian, introduced some GitHub actions, and found faster ways to write.
- I also loved not "marketing" my posts. I didn't post on social media, and I didn't think about SEO at all. I wanted to optimise writing rather than views.

Some struggles during the challenge:

- Writing quality posts was difficult. I often ran out of time to edit. I didn't feel like I was becoming a better writer. But a faster writer.
- There were some topics I couldn't explore because they would take too much time.
- Coming back after breaking my streak was so hard. I was close to giving up at that point.

What's next? I want to move to a more chill posting cadence. Maybe once or twice a week. And there's some other content ideas that I intend to explore. I'm also going to dabble more into marketing my posts, so I can see what resonates with people. Overall, it was a fun challenge. I now know I have ideas to write about!
