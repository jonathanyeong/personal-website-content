Burnout really sneaked up on me. Would not recommend 0/10.

It took me a week into my 5-week break between jobs to realise that I was actually burnt out. And it took almost the entire break to feel energised again.

I had always read about burnout, and I had seen my peers go through it. I get it now. It totally freaking sucks. All I could do after work was stumble over to the couch and watch easy-to-digest TV. *Side note: I'm pretty good at picking out the killer in crime shows now*.

In hindsight, the signs were pretty obvious. But when you're in it, it's hard to tell what's burnout or what's fatigue. There are some great resources on burnout, this one on [CodeSubmit is my fav](https://codesubmit.io/blog/developer-burnout/). 

I'm starting to feel more energised these days, and with that brings a whole lot of excitement about learning new things and engaging with my communities. I'm lucky that I had a chance to take a long break to recover. If you have that time, I recommend it. Especially, if you're able to get out of a toxic work environment in the process. My goal is to take more time out of the day to be kind to oneself. I hope you'll join me!
